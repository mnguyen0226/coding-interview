# Coding Interview Practice for SWE & MLE

## 1. Study Guide

- What are the most relevant problems?
- Understand the goal of practicing coding interview
- Start with easy problems
- Simulate the real world coding interview
- Strategy when you get stuck
  - Clarify the input/output the problem.
  - Read Solution.
  - Try to code the problem on paper from scratch => Find what you don't understand about the problem.
  - Document the problem on Excel.
