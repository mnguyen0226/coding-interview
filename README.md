## 1. Study Guide

- What are the most relevant problems?
- Understand the goal of practicing coding interview
- Start with easy problems
- Simulate the real world coding interview
- Strategy when you get stuck
  - Clarify the input/output the problem.
  - Read Solution.
  - Try to code the problem on paper from scratch => Find what you don't understand about the problem.
  - Document the problem on Excel.

### Array
- Time Complexity - Worst Case:
  - Access: O(1)
  - Search: O(n)
  - Insert: O(n)
  - Remove: O(n)

### Linked Lists

- About: A Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes, each pointing to the next node by means of a pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Generally, we call the first node of a linked list the "head" of the linked list, and we always keep the access of the head of the linked list so that we have access to all the nodes of a linked list.
