# Notes on AVL Trees - Height-balance binary search tree
- Balance Factor of a node = height_left_subtree - height_right_subtree.
- If the BF <= 1 for every node, then the tree is balanced.
- If the BF > 1 for any node, then the tree is imbalanced.
- Rotations for Insertion. There are 4 types of rotations. Note that the rotation is only over 3 nodes
    - LL-rotation.
    - RR-rotation.
    - LR-rotation.
    - RL-rotation.
