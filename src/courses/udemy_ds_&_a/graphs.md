# Notes on Graphs
- Graphs Representation:
    - Adjacency Matrix
    - Adjacency List
    - Compact List

- Breadth First Search: Convert the graph to tree and do level-search
    - Visiting vertice + Exploring vertice = You visit a node, then explore it completely.

- Depth First Search - Similar to pre-order traversal in tree.
    - Use Stack.
    - When you visit the vertice, you visit the next vertice but not neccessary explore all the connection first.

- Spanning Tree
- Prims Minimum Cost Spanning Tree 
    - Find the path that minimize the total (edge-weight) cost
- Kruskals Minimum Cost Spanning Tree
