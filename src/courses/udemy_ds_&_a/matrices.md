## Note on special matrices
- Diagonal matrix
- Lowes Triangular Matrix
- Upper Traingular Matrix
- Symmertric Matrix:
    - M[i][j] = M[j][i]
    - We just need to store either upper or lower triangular matrix and retrieve the other value
- Tridiagonal Matrix
    - Main Diagonal i - j = 0
    - Lower Diagonal i - j = 1
    - Upper Diagonal i - j = -1
    or |i - j| <= 1, M[i][j] must be nonzero
- Band Matrix
- Toeplity Matrix
- Sparse Matrix
