## Note on stack data structure
- Stack is LIFO = Last In First Out
- Data:
    - Space for storing elements
    - Top pointers.
- Operations:
    - Push(x)
    - Pop()
    - Peek(index)
    - StackTop()
    - IsEmpty()
    - IsFull()
- Applications:
    - Paranthesis Matching.
- Infix to Postfix Convertsion
    - What is Postfix?
        - Infix: Operand Operator Operand. Ex: a + b
        - Prefix: Operator Operand Operand. Ex: +ab
        - Postfix: Operand Operand Operator. Ex: ab+
    - Why Postfix?
        - In mathematic equation, there are different order in which we can execute the subset of the equation.
        - We want to calculate everything in 1 scan, prefix form make it not possible but postfix form make it is possible.
    - Precedence?
    - Manual Conversion?
    - We can use stack to convert from prefix to postfix
        - +, - have precedence of 1
        - *, / have precedence of 2
        - a,c,b,... have precedence of 3
        - Note: When pushing a characeter of prefix to a stack, if there is an element on top that has higher precedenc, we need to pop out of the stack.
