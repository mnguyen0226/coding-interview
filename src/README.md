# Personal Note

## 1. Study Guide

- What are the most relevant problems?
- Understand the goal of practicing coding interview
- Start with easy problems
- Simulate the real world coding interview
- Strategy when you get stuck
  - Clarify the input/output the problem.
  - Read Solution.
  - Try to code the problem on paper from scratch => Find what you don't understand about the problem.
  - Document the problem on Excel.

### [How to Prep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UlslIXHNsw&t=2s&ab_channel=EngineeringwithUtsav):

- 1. Assess your skill with example interview
- 2. Review DSA: Reimplement, CTCI
- 3. Create a consistent system to track progress: Have 3 bucket lists - under 30 minutes,
  - TO DO: new problems that you have not yet worked on.
  - REPEAT: Problems that you have worked on but are still making some mistake
  - DONE: Problems that you have nailed and are confident about.
  - How to find question? CTCI, EPI, LeetCode: Pick common DSA From EPI and practices: 40 Easy, 40 medium, 20 Hard
- 4. After 30 mins: Look at solution, learn techniques, take note move on.
- 5. Repeat 5 questions, review the note, understand.
- 6. After a day: score yourself 1-5
  - Did you get the coding solution
  - Did you need hints?
  - Did you finish within 30 mins?
  - Was the solution optimal?
  - Were there any bugs?
